## I. Definition


### Project Overview

Automation of stock trading has been among the most popular uses of advances in hardware and machine learning, and has been a topic of interest to [academics](http://cs229.stanford.edu/proj2012/BernalFokPidaparthi-FinancialMarketTimeSeriesPredictionwithRecurrentNeural.pdf) and practitioners alike. Using algorithms to attempt to identify over- or undervalued companies traded on the stock market is a strategy employed by many investment funds and banks. The stock market is a natural candidate for such analysis because of the vast amount of data, even real-time data, generated by stock markets and companies. For a human it is impossible to filter through all
of this information in a meaningful way, so perhaps machines can help us do this dirty work for us, and provide some new insight.

As there are countless variables impacting stock prices, and a high degree of randomness involved, predicting stock prices with any degree of certainty and consistency seems impossible. However, this approach is employed by such a vast number of different funds and analysts that it would be a useful exercise in its own right to attempt to apply some machine learning techniques to this field in order to better understand its strengths and limitations. With luck, even finding some small insight which could help us filter through some of the noise in the stock market which might give us an edge and narrow our focus when selecting stocks, would be valuable.

The data set in this project consists of five years of stock data for S&P 500 companies. The data includes opening prices, as well as high, low and closing prices. The data set can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/camnugent/sandp500/home


### Problem Statement

The problem I wish to analyze in this project is whether we can predict the future price movements of a stock. Specifically, I will attempt to label stocks as either buy, sell or hold based on changes in its price and the prices of other stocks in the S&P 500 within a period of time, and treat this as a classification problem.

The tasks I will go through are the following:
1. Load the data from a csv-file
2. Explore and visualize the data
3. Preprocess data for machine learning
4. Train a classifier to label stocks as buy, sell or hold
5. Refine to model improve it over the benchmark model

"Solving" the problem is measured by classifying some stock as either a buy or sell, or to simply keep holding the stock. As such it is quantifiable and easy to understand. To help me solve this problem I will utilize supervised learning, more specifically SVM, k-nearest neighbors and random forest classifiers.

### Metrics

Accuracy, precision and AUC could all be relevant metrics to measure performance of a model in this project. Accuracy requires the data set classes to be balanced, and this is only true to a certain extent in this case. We will still consider the accuracy of the model, but I believe *precision* could be the key metric to judge the model on. One way this project might influence our trading strategy would be to use the model to identify candidate stocks to buy. In this case, we want to be fairly certain that if the model classifies a stock as buy, this can be trusted. We want to limit the amount of false positives, as this could cause us to lose a lot of money. This favors precision as a metric. Conversely, we can accept some type-II errors from the model. That is, failing to identify possible buy-candidates. This would be a lost opportunity, but not something that would cause us to lose money. All of this points towards precision as a valid metric.

## II. Analysis
_(approx. 2-4 pages)_

### Data Exploration
In this section, you will be expected to analyze the data you are using for the problem. This data can either be in the form of a data set (or data sets), input data (or input files), or even an environment. The type of data should be thoroughly described and, if possible, have basic statistics and information presented (such as discussion of input features or defining characteristics about the input or environment). Any abnormalities or interesting qualities about the data that may need to be addressed have been identified (such as features that need to be transformed or the possibility of outliers). Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _If a dataset is present for this problem, have you thoroughly discussed certain features about the dataset? Has a data sample been provided to the reader?_
- _If a dataset is present for this problem, are statistics about the dataset calculated and reported? Have any relevant results from this calculation been discussed?_
- _Are there any abnormalities or characteristics about the input space or dataset that need to be addressed? (categorical variables, missing values, outliers, etc.)_

The data set contains price data and trade volume for all S&P500 stocks over a five year period. The data is separated into seven columns:
- date - In format year-month-day, starting from earliest date
- open - stock price in USD at market opening (float)
- high - daily high of the stock price (float)
- low - daily low of the stock price (float)
- close - stock price at market close (float)
- volume - number of stocks traded during the day (integer)
- name - the stock ticker (string)

The data set contains 619 040 rows of data. Each row contains a set of prices for a certain stock ticker, for a certain date. Data has been captured from February 2003 and going till February 2018.

### Exploratory Visualization
In this section, you will need to provide some form of visualization that summarizes or extracts a relevant characteristic or feature about the data. The visualization should adequately support the data being used. Discuss why this visualization was chosen and how it is relevant. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Have you visualized a relevant characteristic or feature about the dataset or input data?_
- _Is the visualization thoroughly analyzed and discussed?_
- _If a plot is provided, are the axes, title, and datum clearly defined?_

The focus of this study will be on closing prices for each day, ignoring intra-day fluctuations. To organize the data frame I will pivot the data frame using date as index, with one column for each stock ticker.

```python
def get_df():
    df = pd.read_csv('./data/all_stocks_5yr.csv')
    df = df.pivot(index='date', columns='Name', values='close')

    return df
```
Each row is now a date containing price data for all stocks in the index, reducing the total number of rows in the data set from 619 040 to 1 259.

So what can we use all of this pricing data for? Plotting a stock (column) over time gives us a nice visualization of the stocks performance over time. This is a useful starting point for any analysis, and gives us hints of general performance, volatility, seasonality and other factors.

As we can see from looking at the share prices of Google (above) and Apple (below), their stocks have performed well over the last five years. This is not surprising, as we are looking at two of the most successful tech companies operating today. However, it is interesting to note both stocks seem to experience a marked decline at the end of our time period. In fact, this probably did not have anything to do with the companies themselves. A lot of stocks fell in February 2018, which was the worth month for the S&P 500 in two years. Some stocks fell more than others, while some didn't fall at all.

The heatmap reveals correlation between groups of companies. We know that stocks in general have tended to increase in value over time, but the heatmap reveals both positive and negative correlation, of different strength. If we infer from this that the price of groups of companies tend to move together, can we gain an edge by studying this relationship using machine learning? The assumption that certain companies move together makes a lot of sense. For instance, we expect the profits (and thus share price) of companies in the oil industry to be linked to the oil price, and we expect retail companies to linked to eg. the disposable income of consumers or the unemployment rate. There might also be relationships that are less obvious to a human, but might be revealed using machine learning. In most cases, we would not expect the stock prices to move simultaneously for all companies. Some companies will lead, some will lag. It is this relationship I want to study more closely, which might give us an edge in deciding whether to buy, sell or hold a certain stock.

### Algorithms and Techniques
In this section, you will need to discuss the algorithms and techniques you intend to use for solving the problem. You should justify the use of each one based on the characteristics of the problem and the problem domain. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Are the algorithms you will use, including any default variables/parameters in the project clearly defined?_
- _Are the techniques to be used thoroughly discussed and justified?_
- _Is it made clear how the input data or datasets will be handled by the algorithms and techniques chosen?_

### Benchmark
In this section, you will need to provide a clearly defined benchmark result or threshold for comparing across performances obtained by your solution. The reasoning behind the benchmark (in the case where it is not an established result) should be discussed. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Has some result or value been provided that acts as a benchmark for measuring performance?_
- _Is it clear how this result or value was obtained (whether by data or by hypothesis)?_

As a benchmark I'll use an out-of-the-box SVM, which we can hopefully outperform.

## III. Methodology
_(approx. 3-5 pages)_

### Data Preprocessing
In this section, all of your preprocessing steps will need to be clearly documented, if any were necessary. From the previous section, any of the abnormalities or characteristics that you identified about the dataset will be addressed and corrected here. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _If the algorithms chosen require preprocessing steps like feature selection or feature transformations, have they been properly documented?_
- _Based on the **Data Exploration** section, if there were abnormalities or characteristics that needed to be addressed, have they been properly corrected?_
- _If no preprocessing is needed, has it been made clear why?_

### Implementation
In this section, the process for which metrics, algorithms, and techniques that you implemented for the given data will need to be clearly documented. It should be abundantly clear how the implementation was carried out, and discussion should be made regarding any complications that occurred during this process. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Is it made clear how the algorithms and techniques were implemented with the given datasets or input data?_
- _Were there any complications with the original metrics or techniques that required changing prior to acquiring a solution?_
- _Was there any part of the coding process (e.g., writing complicated functions) that should be documented?_

### Refinement
In this section, you will need to discuss the process of improvement you made upon the algorithms and techniques you used in your implementation. For example, adjusting parameters for certain models to acquire improved solutions would fall under the refinement category. Your initial and final solutions should be reported, as well as any significant intermediate results as necessary. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Has an initial solution been found and clearly reported?_
- _Is the process of improvement clearly documented, such as what techniques were used?_
- _Are intermediate and final solutions clearly reported as the process is improved?_


## IV. Results
_(approx. 2-3 pages)_

### Model Evaluation and Validation
In this section, the final model and any supporting qualities should be evaluated in detail. It should be clear how the final model was derived and why this model was chosen. In addition, some type of analysis should be used to validate the robustness of this model and its solution, such as manipulating the input data or environment to see how the model’s solution is affected (this is called sensitivity analysis). Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Is the final model reasonable and aligning with solution expectations? Are the final parameters of the model appropriate?_
- _Has the final model been tested with various inputs to evaluate whether the model generalizes well to unseen data?_
- _Is the model robust enough for the problem? Do small perturbations (changes) in training data or the input space greatly affect the results?_
- _Can results found from the model be trusted?_

### Justification
In this section, your model’s final solution and its results should be compared to the benchmark you established earlier in the project using some type of statistical analysis. You should also justify whether these results and the solution are significant enough to have solved the problem posed in the project. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Are the final results found stronger than the benchmark result reported earlier?_
- _Have you thoroughly analyzed and discussed the final solution?_
- _Is the final solution significant enough to have solved the problem?_


## V. Conclusion
_(approx. 1-2 pages)_

### Free-Form Visualization
In this section, you will need to provide some form of visualization that emphasizes an important quality about the project. It is much more free-form, but should reasonably support a significant result or characteristic about the problem that you want to discuss. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Have you visualized a relevant or important quality about the problem, dataset, input data, or results?_
- _Is the visualization thoroughly analyzed and discussed?_
- _If a plot is provided, are the axes, title, and datum clearly defined?_

### Reflection
In this section, you will summarize the entire end-to-end problem solution and discuss one or two particular aspects of the project you found interesting or difficult. You are expected to reflect on the project as a whole to show that you have a firm understanding of the entire process employed in your work. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Have you thoroughly summarized the entire process you used for this project?_
- _Were there any interesting aspects of the project?_
- _Were there any difficult aspects of the project?_
- _Does the final model and solution fit your expectations for the problem, and should it be used in a general setting to solve these types of problems?_

### Improvement
In this section, you will need to provide discussion as to how one aspect of the implementation you designed could be improved. As an example, consider ways your implementation can be made more general, and what would need to be modified. You do not need to make this improvement, but the potential solutions resulting from these changes are considered and compared/contrasted to your current solution. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Are there further improvements that could be made on the algorithms or techniques you used in this project?_
- _Were there algorithms or techniques you researched that you did not know how to implement, but would consider using if you knew how?_
- _If you used your final solution as the new benchmark, do you think an even better solution exists?_
