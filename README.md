### Domain Background
_(approx. 1-2 paragraphs)_

Automation of stock trading has been among the most popular uses of advances in
hardware and machine learning, and has been a topic of interest to academics (http://cs229.stanford.edu/proj2012/BernalFokPidaparthi-FinancialMarketTimeSeriesPredictionwithRecurrentNeural.pdf)
and practitioners alike. Using algorithms to attempt to identify over- or
undervalued companies traded on the stock market is a strategy employed by many
investment funds and banks. The stock market is a natural candidate for such
analysis because of the vast amount of data, even real-time time, generated by
stock markets and companies. For a human it is impossible to filter through all
of this information in a meaningful way, so perhaps machines can help us do this
dirty work for us, and provide some new insight.

Personally I have doubts regarding the value of such an approach, as there are
so many variables impacting stock prices, and so much randomness, that predicting
stock prices with any degree of certainty and consistency seems impossible.
However, this approach is employed by such a vast number of different funds and
analysts that it would be a useful exercise in its own right to attempt to
apply some machine learning techniques to this field to better understand its
strengths and limitations. With luck, even finding some small insight which could
help us filter through some of the noise in the stock market might give us an
edge and narrow our focus when selecting stocks, would be valuable.

### Problem Statement
_(approx. 1 paragraph)_

The problem I wish to analyze in this project is whether we can predict the
future price of a stock. The scope of this project will be limited due to time
constraints, so I will initially attempt to predict future prices based on
historical prices. This is unlikely to provide great insight in itself, but might
be a useful starting point to elaborate further on, and expand the analysis.


### Datasets and Inputs
_(approx. 2-3 paragraphs)_

My data set consists of five years of stock data for SP 500 companies. The data
includes opening prices, as well as high, low and closing prices. The data set
can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/camnugent/sandp500/home

I also have data sets containing financial figures for the same companies, which
may or may not be used, depending on how the project develops and the time I
have available.

### Solution Statement
_(approx. 1 paragraph)_

"Solving" the problem is measured by obtaining future stock prices in USD, and
is as such quantifiable and easy to understand.

### Benchmark Model
_(approximately 1-2 paragraphs)_

In this section, provide the details for a benchmark model or result that relates to the domain, problem statement, and intended solution. Ideally, the benchmark model or result contextualizes existing methods or known information in the domain and problem given, which could then be objectively compared to the solution. Describe how the benchmark model or result is measurable (can be measured by some metric and clearly observed) with thorough detail.

### Evaluation Metrics
_(approx. 1-2 paragraphs)_

In this section, propose at least one evaluation metric that can be used to quantify the performance of both the benchmark model and the solution model. The evaluation metric(s) you propose should be appropriate given the context of the data, the problem statement, and the intended solution. Describe how the evaluation metric(s) are derived and provide an example of their mathematical representations (if applicable). Complex evaluation metrics should be clearly defined and quantifiable (can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms).

### Project Design
_(approx. 1 page)_

Coming up with a capstone proposal I have spent a lot of time thinking about
different problems, starting to work on some, quickly discarding others. Simply
coming up with a problem for the project that is relevant, viable and realistic
to complete has been challenging. I have found it especially hard not to focus
on all of the different reasons why potential projects might be too complicated,
or all the difficulties that can arise trying to apply ML-techniques to problems.

In the process of writing this proposal, I have gone through several data sets
trying to find the most suitable ones. At first I attempted to create my own
data set via Quandl's API, and I tried to improve upon a data set I downloaded
using Yahoo Finance some time ago, only to find that they no longer offer the
same services as before.

My task now is preparing the data set for further analysis, and preprocessing it
for machine learning.

In this final section, summarize a theoretical workflow for approaching a solution given the problem. Provide thorough discussion for what strategies you may consider employing, what analysis of the data might be required before being used, or which algorithms will be considered for your implementation. The workflow and discussion that you provide should align with the qualities of the previous sections. Additionally, you are encouraged to include small visualizations, pseudocode, or diagrams to aid in describing the project design, but it is not required. The discussion should clearly outline your intended workflow of the capstone project.

-----------

**Before submitting your proposal, ask yourself. . .**

- Does the proposal you have written follow a well-organized structure similar to that of the project template?
- Is each section (particularly **Solution Statement** and **Project Design**) written in a clear, concise and specific fashion? Are there any ambiguous terms or phrases that need clarification?
- Would the intended audience of your project be able to understand your proposal?
- Have you properly proofread your proposal to assure there are minimal grammatical and spelling mistakes?
- Are all the resources used for this project correctly cited and referenced?
